At the moment, creating API Application will be by request only. Please provide these information to our developer to get your API Application setup :

- Your Eventpop organizer name or ID
- Your designated `Callback URL` when user is logged in and authorized with your app. eg. `https://your-awesome-app.com/oauth/callback`
Then you'll get `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from us, they'll be used for user / app authentication, keep them secret
